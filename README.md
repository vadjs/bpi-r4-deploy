# OpenWrt for Banana Pi BPI-R4 (kernel 6.12)

OpenWrt 25.12 for Banana Pi BPI-R4 (MT7988, Wi-Fi 7) with a complete install system that runs entirely on GitHub — no Linux machine needed.

---

## What you get

- **SD card image** — boot OpenWrt directly from SD card, no installation needed.
- **NVMe install** — install OpenWrt permanently to an NVMe SSD. Includes Docker and a dedicated data partition (p3) that uses all remaining disk space.
- **eMMC install** — install OpenWrt permanently to the internal eMMC storage.
- **Sysupgrade support** — update your NVMe system directly from LuCI (System → Backup / Flash Firmware) or from the command line.

---

## Two build types

This project offers two separate builds. **Choose the one that matches your installation target:**

| Build type | What it is | Use when |
|------------|------------|----------|
| **NVMe** | OpenWrt with Docker pre-installed, larger partitions, dedicated data partition (p3) | You are installing to an NVMe SSD |
| **SD / eMMC** | Standard OpenWrt, smaller footprint | You are installing to SD card or eMMC |

> ⚠️ **The NVMe build will not fit on eMMC.** Always use the correct build for your target.

---

## DIP switch reference

| Boot medium  | SW3-A | SW3-B |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| SD card      | 0     | 0     |
| NAND rescue  | 0     | 1     |
| eMMC         | 1     | 0     |

> **NVMe boot** is controlled by U-Boot environment, not by DIP switch. After running `install-nvme.sh`, the device will boot from NVMe automatically on every power-on — as long as DIP is set to **NAND** (SW3-A=0, SW3-B=1).

---

## Part A — Use the ready-made release (no customization)

No setup needed. Just follow the steps below.

### Option 1 — SD card (simplest)

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/woziwrt/bpi-r4-deploy/releases/tag/release-sdcard) and download `openwrt-mediatek-filogic-bananapi_bpi-r4-sdcard.img.gz`.
2. Flash it to your SD card using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
3. Insert the SD card into BPI-R4, set DIP **SW3-A=0, SW3-B=0** and power on.
4. Connect via SSH: `ssh root@192.168.1.1` (no password by default). Alternatively, open LuCI at **http://192.168.1.1 → Services → Terminal**.

That's it — OpenWrt is running from your SD card.

---

### Option 2 — NVMe install (recommended for permanent use)

> ⚠️ **If you want both NVMe and eMMC:** Always run `install-emmc.sh` (Option 3) **before** `install-nvme.sh`. After NVMe installation, the device always boots from NVMe automatically — eMMC installation will no longer be possible without manual intervention.

This installs OpenWrt to an NVMe SSD. After installation, the SD card is no longer needed.

The NVMe build includes:
- **Docker** — pre-installed, starts on demand (not automatic).
- **p3 data partition** — all remaining disk space is automatically formatted as ext4 and available at `/mnt/nvme0n1p3`. Docker data is stored here.

#### What you need
- A microSD card (any size, 1 GB is enough).
- An NVMe SSD installed in BPI-R4.
- A network cable connected to BPI-R4 during installation.

#### Step 1 — Flash the rescue SD card

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/woziwrt/bpi-r4-deploy/releases/tag/release-sdcard) and download `bpi-r4-rescue-sdcard.img.gz`.
2. Flash it to your SD card using [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
3. Insert the SD card into BPI-R4.
4. Set DIP **SW3-A=0, SW3-B=0** (SD boot) and power on.
5. Connect via SSH: `ssh root@192.168.1.1` (no password). Alternatively, open LuCI at **http://192.168.1.1 → Services → Terminal**.

#### Step 2 — Install NAND rescue system

```sh
/root/bpi-r4-install/install-nand.sh
```

Wait for the script to finish. Then:

1. Power off BPI-R4.
2. Set DIP **SW3-A=0, SW3-B=1** (NAND boot) and power on.
3. Connect via SSH: `ssh root@192.168.1.1` — or open LuCI at **http://192.168.1.1 → Services → Terminal**.

#### Step 3 — Install OpenWrt to NVMe

Make sure the network cable is connected, then run:

```sh
/root/bpi-r4-install/install-nvme.sh
```

The script will ask you a few questions:

- **File source** — always select **[1] Download from GitHub**. Option [2] is for development only.
- **Release source** — select **[1] Default** to use the official release, or **[2] My fork** if you have your own fork with a custom build.

Then the script will:
- Check your NVMe disk health (SMART).
- Download the required images from GitHub automatically (~150 MB).
- Write OpenWrt to your NVMe SSD (p1: kernel, p2: rootfs, p3: data).
- Set up automatic NVMe boot.
- Reboot automatically.

After reboot, BPI-R4 boots from NVMe. The SD card is no longer needed.

> **Updating** — to update OpenWrt on NVMe, boot into NAND rescue (DIP SW3-A=0, SW3-B=1, then power on) and run `install-nvme.sh` again. It will update the kernel and rootfs without touching your data on p3.

---

### Option 3 — eMMC install

This installs OpenWrt to the internal eMMC storage. Follow the same steps as NVMe install (Steps 1 and 2), then run:

```sh
/root/bpi-r4-install/install-emmc.sh
```

The script will ask you a few questions:

- **File source** — always select **[1] Download from GitHub**. Option [2] is for development only.
- **Release source** — select **[1] Default** to use the official release, or **[2] My fork** if you have your own fork.

Then the script downloads the eMMC image (~103 MB) and writes it automatically.

After installation:
1. Power off BPI-R4.
2. Set DIP **SW3-A=1, SW3-B=0** (eMMC boot) and power on.

> ⚠️ eMMC install has been tested but eMMC boot is less commonly used. NVMe is the recommended option for permanent installation.

---

### Sysupgrade (updating NVMe system from LuCI)

Once running from NVMe, you can update OpenWrt without any scripts:

1. Download `bpi-r4.itb` from the [NVMe Releases](https://github.com/woziwrt/bpi-r4-deploy/releases/tag/release-nvme) page.
2. In LuCI, go to **System → Backup / Flash Firmware**.
3. Under **Flash new firmware image**, upload `bpi-r4.itb`.
4. Uncheck **Keep settings** if you want a clean install, or leave it checked to keep your configuration.
5. Click **Flash image** and confirm.

BPI-R4 will update kernel and rootfs and reboot automatically. Your data on p3 is never touched.

---

## Part B — Fork and customize (advanced users)

Fork this repository to build your own customized release — add or remove packages, then install from your own GitHub release.

### Step 1 — Fork the repository

Fork this repository on GitHub. **Do not rename the fork** — it must stay named `bpi-r4-deploy`, otherwise the install scripts will not find your release.

### Step 2 — Enable workflows and set permissions

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your fork and enable workflows.
2. Open **Settings → Actions → General** and set:
   - **Actions permissions**: Allow all actions and reusable workflows.
   - **Workflow permissions**: **Read and write permissions** — required to create releases. The default is read-only, change this manually.

> ⚠️ Without **Read and write permissions** the workflow will fail when trying to create a release.

### Step 3 — Customize packages

1. In your fork, open `configs/my_final_defconfig`.
2. Click the pencil icon to edit directly on GitHub.
3. You will see lines like:
   ```
   CONFIG_PACKAGE_iperf3=y
   CONFIG_PACKAGE_htop is not set
   ```
   - `=y` → package enabled
   - `is not set` → package disabled
4. Change lines to enable or disable packages.
5. **Only change lines starting with `CONFIG_PACKAGE_`.** Do not touch kernel, target, or MTK SDK options.
6. Click **Commit changes**.

### Step 4 — Trigger a build

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your fork.
2. Select **Build BPI-R4**.
3. Click **Run workflow**. You will see two options:
   - **Build type** — select what you want to build:
     - **nvme** — NVMe version (Docker, large partitions, p3 data partition).
     - **sdcard** — SD/eMMC version (standard partitions).
   - **Commit hash** — leave empty to build the latest version. You can enter a specific commit hash if you want to build an older version.
4. Click **Run workflow** and confirm.
5. After the workflow finishes (approx. 2 hours), a release will be created in your fork:
   - NVMe build → tagged `release-nvme`
   - SD/eMMC build → tagged `release-sdcard`

> Both releases can exist at the same time. Running one build does not affect the other.

### Step 5 — Install from your fork

When running `install-nvme.sh` or `install-emmc.sh`, select option **[2] My fork** and enter your GitHub username:

```
  [1] Default (woziwrt/bpi-r4-deploy)
  [2] My fork (same repo name, different username)

  Select [1/2]: 2
        Enter your GitHub username: johndoe
        URL: https://github.com/johndoe/bpi-r4-deploy/releases/download/release-nvme
```

The URL is displayed so you can verify it before the download starts.

> ⚠️ **Before running the install script**, make sure you have triggered a build in your fork and the release exists. If the release is missing, the script will tell you exactly what to do.

## Notes

- This build is for Banana Pi BPI-R4 only (MT7988, 2x SFP+).
- OpenWrt and MTK SDK commits are pinned in the build script. Updating them requires manual editing.
- 8 GB RAM variants (`bpi-r4-8g`, `bpi-r4-poe-8g`) are separate build targets. The standard 4 GB image limits Linux to 4 GB even on 8 GB hardware — use the dedicated 8 GB images to expose the full memory.
- Docker is included in the NVMe build but does not start automatically. To start Docker: `/etc/init.d/dockerd start`

### Notes about GitHub runners

This workflow runs on GitHub-hosted runners where free disk space is not guaranteed. If a build fails with a disk-related error, re-run the workflow — runners with sufficient space (~100 GB free) are usually available within a short time.

External mirrors used during the build can also be temporarily slow or unavailable. Re-running the workflow later usually resolves this.
